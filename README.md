# Supervised
Analysis:

Best Performing Model:

In this example, the Random Forest Classifier performed the best with an accuracy of 96.49%.

Worst Performing Model:

The Decision Tree Classifier performed the worst with an accuracy of 92.98%.

Explanation:

Random Forest generally performs well due to its ensemble nature, combining multiple decision trees to reduce overfitting and increase accuracy.

Decision Tree, while useful for interpreting individual decisions, may overfit on training data, leading to lower performance on test data compared to ensemble methods like Random Forest.
